            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                According to PEW Research<sup>1</sup>, 96% of adults between 18-29 occasionally consult reviews before making a
                purchase. But does this mean that higher ratings result in more product sales? Specifically, what do
                higher ratings indicate for video game sales? Maybe higher ratings lead to more game sales. But could
                some more obscure games with a dedicated group of followers receive higher ratings than popular
                games with significant sales volume? I am also curious whether there has been an increase in the
                production of games in recent years and, if so, what effect this increase has on the quality of games
                based on review scores. Is it possible that an increase in the number of games results in review scores
                decreasing with the oversaturation of video game releases?
            </p>
            <p>
                In this project, I plan to use Metacritic’s user and critic review scores to see if there is a correlation
                between the scores of a game and its overall sales. I will be joining the review data with sales data
                obtained from VGChartz.

            <h2>2. Data</h2>
            <p>
                This project uses two primary sources of data: Metacritic’s<sup>2</sup> game critic and game player review scores
                of different games and VGChartz<sup>3</sup> data about video game sales.
            </p>
            
            <h3>2.1 Review Scores</h3>
            <p>
                I collected data from Metacritic, which contained user (user score) and critic (meta score) review scores
                for each game.
            </p>
            <p>
                Metacritic’s data was found on 186 different web pages. I wrote a web crawling script to collect all data
                across these 186 pages. I collected the game title, summary, platform, user score, meta score, and
                release date for 18,526 games. Some of the results were the same game that was released on different
                platforms, which is essential to consider when I begin merging the data. I created a data frame which is
                contained in the Metacritic.csv file in the project folder. The web crawling script that I wrote is
                contained in the metacritic.R file in the project folder.
            </p>
            <p>
                The data didn’t need much cleaning; however, to make the platform match with the VGChartz data, I
                created a dictionary to convert Metacritic’s platform data to match VGChartz. This cleaning was done in
                the file combining_vgs.R.
            </p>
            
            <h3>2.2 Video Game Sales</h3>
            <p>
                The website VGChartz provides sales data about the number of units of each game/platform
                combination sold.
            </p>
            <p>
                The information was contained in 1,249 web pages. Due to the extensive nature of the data, I decided to
                break the web crawling results into six different CSV files (VGChartz_0 – 5.csv), all contained in the
                project folder. The web crawling script is contained in the vgchartz.R file in the project folder.
            </p>
            <p>
                I collected the game, platform, release date, publisher, and sales data from PAL, Japan, and North
                America as well as total game sales for 62,398 games. Like the Metacritic data, some of these games
                were released on multiple platforms, which count as a unique observation in the data. Another
                interesting thing to note is that series were counted in this data frame alongside their individual
                counterparts. For example, Super Mario is counted as a series, but each entry in the series is also
                contained in the dataset. This was handled in the cleaning of the data.
            </p>
            <p>
                In cleaning the data, I merged all six VGChartz .csv files into one complete file using row bind to build a
                complete data frame. I also removed unnecessary columns, trimmed the white space on the title, and
                returned only the distinct values of the dataset. When I read the CSV into the script, I created NA values
                where data was missing. I also removed the game series by filtering them out during data cleaning. This
                cleaning was done in the file combining_vgs.R.
            </p>
            
            <h3>2.3 Combining Reviews and Sales</h3>
            <p>
                Since both data sets included the same game title multiple times based on the platform, I had to merge
                based on both the game title and platform. Both data sets are also vastly different in the number of
                observations. I decided to create two separate data sets in merging. One data set is the intersection of
                the data and only contains data that appears in both data sets. The other data set, called the union,
                contains all rows from both data sets. All this work was done in the combining_vgs.R file in the project
                folder. Next, I imported both data frames into the cleaning_vgs.R file in the project folder for further
                cleaning.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the differentiator between both data frames is their number of rows and most of my cleaning was
                regarding the columns, I created a function to iterate over both data sets to clean them. This cleaning
                included trimming the white space on the summary and publisher, turning the sales data into numeric,
                and adding the platform, publisher, and title as factors. I also turned all the release dates into a “Month,
                Year” format and combined the release date from VGChartz and Metacritic into one column. Next, I
                dropped all sales data except North America sales and total sales. I also dropped the extra release date
                column, and the index columns. I exported these datasets to VGSales_union.csv and
                VGSales_intersect.csv, respectively. The union had 68,288 observations, and the intersect had 12,288
                observations. A description of each variable is contained in Table 1.

            <h2>3. Analysis</h2>

            <h3>3.1 Video Game Ratings and Sales</h3>
            <p>
                I wanted to find out whether games with higher reviews sell more and navigate the relationship
                between the different types of sales and review scores. I started by calculating correlation coefficients
                to explore the relationship between variables. There was a correlation coefficient of .954 between the
                total sales and North American sales. This is evidence of an extremely strong correlation between these
                two variables. North American sales make up 48.7% of the total sales, which is a significant reason for
                this strong correlation. However, the correlation between sales and review scores was very weak.
            </p>
            <p>
                The correlation coefficient between total sales and meta score was .248, and it was .102 between total sales
                and user score. While there was a moderate correlation between user score and meta score at .524, it is
                nowhere near as strong as it was between the two sales variables.
            </p>
            <h3>3.2 Video Game Publishers</h3>
            <p>
                To find out which video game publishers have the highest sales, I created a summary data frame,
                publisher_df, which was grouped by the publisher. In this data frame, I included the ratings’ average, the
                sales’ sum, and the number of games each publisher has released.
            </p>
            <p>
                The coefficient of correlation between the total sales and the number of games a publisher had released
                was .715, which demonstrates a strong correlation between the number of games released and the total
                sales of a publisher.
            </p>
            <h3>3.3 Release Date</h3>
            <p>
                To determine how sales, number of games released, and review scores have changed, I created a data
                frame called by_month, which grouped the games by month and calculated the average review scores,
                the sum of sales, and the number of games.
            </p>
            <p>
                The correlation coefficient between the release date and the number of games released is .533, which is
                evidence of some correlation, but it is not especially strong. Figure 5 reveals a large peak in the number
                of games released around 2010 before decreasing again. The sales of games did not see this same spike.
